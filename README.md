## Abstract/Instructions

Lyrix is an application that allows users to test their knowledge of top-charting song lyrics. The user can select a trending song from the LastFM Charts API and try to guess a missing word from a line of lyrics. We have conveniently linked the playable song, so you simply need to open the link, press play, and start playing! Players can favorite a song and save it for latter, keep track of their current and high scores, and navigate to the "Play" play at any time to pick a different song. 

## Technologies Used: 

This application was built using React hooks and functional components. For routing, we used the Hooks-Router library, and for testing, we used the React Testing Library with Jest as a test runner.
